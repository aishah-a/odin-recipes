    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Few desserts say summer like Eton mess. Crunchy meringue, whipped cream and strawberry sauce is a winning combination, best served al fresco.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large egg whites</li>
        <li>120g caster sugar</li>
        <li>500g strawberries, hulled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>450ml double cream</li>
        <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 120C/100C fan/gas 1 and line a large baking tray with parchment paper. Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl using an electric whisk or tabletop mixer until they reach stiff peaks, then add the sugar in 3 lots, re-whisking to stiff peaks every time.</li>
            
        <li>Spoon dollops of the mixture onto the baking parchment, cook on the bottom shelf of the oven for 1hr – 1hr15 mins until the meringues are completely hard and come off the paper easily. Leave to cool.</li>

        <li>Blitz 1/3 of the strawberries to make a strawberry sauce. In a large bowl whisk the cream with the icing sugar until it just holds its shape. Roughly crush ¾ of the meringues and tip them in with the chopped strawberries and stir, then swirl through the strawberry sauce.</li>
        
        <li>Dollop into bowls then crush the remaining meringues, sprinkling the pieces over the top.</li>
    </ol>
